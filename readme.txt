To run me code, put your data folders of atis, wsj, brown in the folder PartOfSpeechTaggedData/ 
then you just need to run run.sh (using bash run.sh in Linux terminal). 
It will show trace file analogous to the BigramModel trace file on course page in the terminal. 
You can also run run and output to file.sh (using bash run and output to file.sh in Linux terminal). 
That will show trace file in the terminal and generate a file ./traceFile/traceFile.txt. 
You can see trace file for all three models in the traceFile.txt.
